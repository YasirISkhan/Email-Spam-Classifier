# Email-Spam-Classifier Using Naive Bayes Algorithm

Spam emails have increased in recent years due to accelarating advertisements. Therefore, We build an email spam classifier that categorizes whether an email is spam or ham (original). We used an existing dataset available on Kaggle. After some preprocessing and feature engineering, we utilized Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm to train our model. Resultantly, we received an impressive accuracy score of 94% on testing text.
